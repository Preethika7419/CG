ABSTRACT 
The abstract keyword is a non-access modifier, used for classes and methods.

Class: An abstract class is a restricted class that cannot be used to
 create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).

Method: An abstract method can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. 
The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from).

FINAL
The final keyword is a non-access modifier used for classes, attributes and methods, which makes them non-changeable (impossible to inherit or override).
If you make any method as final, you cannot override it.
The final keyword is useful when you want a variable to always store the same value, like PI (3.14159...).

The final keyword is called a "modifier".
